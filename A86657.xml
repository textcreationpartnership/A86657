            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Fifteen Queſtions Propoſed to, and Anſwer'd by Mr. <hi>Robert Howſon</hi> Maſter of Arts, and Miniſter of Gods Word in <hi>POOLE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Q.</hi> WHether it be not the duty of every Chriſtian, to chooſe the Communion of the beſt Society; and whether in the choice thereof? He is bound to follow his own judgment, after the beſt Information he is able to attain unto, or other Mens Judgments againſt his own 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. c. 7. v.</p>
            <p n="1">1 A. <hi>There is no Man can judge ſo far of Mens Perſons, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies, as to ſay ſuch are good, or ſuch are bad; the</hi> Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees <hi>were accounted by themſelves, and others the beſt of Men, while indeed they were the worſt.</hi> Mat. 23. <hi>from the</hi> 13th v. <hi>and the</hi> Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans <hi>(who were accounted the worſt of Men) are ſaid to go into the Kingdom of Heaven before them; Men are good or bad in themſelves toward God, ſo far only as their Natures are renewed, and as they are transformed into the Image of God: And they are good and bad to us, ſo far as they walk according to, or differing from the Word of God, the moſt viſſible and certain rule of a Chriſtian Converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether it be not the duty of every Chriſtian, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from every Brother that walks diſorderly, not after the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions received from the Apoſtles, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. c. 6. v.</p>
            <p n="2">2 A. <hi>It is ſo? Therefore every Man or every Society of Men, that maintain erronious Principles, or live in Vicious or Wicked Practices, are to be ſeparated from, and puniſhed by the Power that Chriſt hath given to his Church under the Goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Mat. 18.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether it be not Incongruous and Heterogenial, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh corporally, Men erring ſpiritually, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. c. 24, 25. v.</p>
            <p n="3">3 A. <hi>If after all meekneſs and aptneſs to teach and patience there meant: The erring Brother will rather refuſe to hear, or continue to oppoſe; the puniſhing of the Body may conduce to the ſaving of the Soul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. <hi>Gold and Droſs are Heterogenial, yet the fire ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates between them, according to the Philoſophical Maxim,</hi> Ignis ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Heterogenea, &amp; congregat Homogenea.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:135336:3"/>4 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether ſecular force and compulſion in things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Supernatural Revelation, be the way of Chriſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat his Church, or whether his People be not a willing People in the days of his Power. 11 <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 3. v.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether any one can be compell'd by ſecular force or compulſion, to perform any one Religious duty acceptably, ſince God accepts not of any, but what is voluntary and of Faith, which cannot be forc'd and of what uſe then is ſecular force and compulſion in Religion, but to make Men Sin or Suffer, and as for thoſe words uſually urged out of that Parable: go forth and compel them to come in, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. I pray Sir conſider they that were invited and ſlighted this kindneſs ſhown, where they were compell'd: And thoſe that it is ſaid they ſhould compell, ſhow that they refuſed: And I pray deal ingeniouſly, and tell me whether that compulſion was any other than by ſetting before them the benefits offered, and ſo compelling them by force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="4">4 and 5 A. <hi>Though ſecular force and compulſion do not perſwade Mens minds, or perfect Chriſts Church; yet it doth and may bring Men unto thoſe Goſpel and Spiritual means (which by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit) may effectually perſwade and ſave. School Boys are whipt to School, and yet for all that many of them do love their buſineſs and like there books, and have cauſe to bleſs God they ever were forc'd and compell'd: When I was in my Youthful Age, fear of Puniſhment did force me to thoſe Ordinances, in which I found and felt much good, and for which I ſhall have cauſe to be eternally thankful; and I do more than believe that many have (by force off Eccleſiaſtical cenſures) been brought to a Communion with our Church, in which they have experienced much of Gods grace and goodneſs, and for which they are now magnifying his Name and Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether Chriſts Rule to his Diſciples under the Goſpel, be not a Spiritual Power, and whether to uſe the Temporal Sword in Religious matters, be not to make the Weapons of the Goſpel not mighty through God, according to that in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4, 5. But mighty through the Majeſtrates Power, and to arm the Church with Weapons, Chriſt never gave her, and to make her rather a Millitary, than a Spiritual Society.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:135336:3"/>7 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether to ſay the Spiritual Power Chriſt hath given to the Church, for the right ordering and governing thereof, is not ſufficient for that end, without the aid and aſſistance of Secular Power be not to Blaſpheme.</p>
            <p n="6">6 and 7 A. <hi>Under the Goſpel the Spiritual Rule of Chriſt, is to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his Church by his Spirit and Word, and the only Weapons of the Church are Prayers and Tears, and not Guns and Swords, ſuch as were moſt ſhamefully uſed by the Diſſenters from our Church (to the great ſcandal of Religion) in the late Bloody Tragedy of our National and Civil War, which ended in the moſt barbarous Cataſtrophy,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſpilling of the beſt Blood that ever circled in meer humane Veins. As to the Temporal Sword you ſpake off, at worſt 'tis but a Rod of Church Diſcipline, ſuch as the Apoſtle taught and order'd to be uſed.</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. c. 4.21. V. <hi>And that not in oppoſition to the great Law and Rule of the Spirit, in things Spiritual and Eſſential to Salvation, but in great Subordination to that Law, and to that Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If the Spirit of God under Goſpel diſpenſations, work upon Mens Hearts and Conſciences by the outward means of Prayer, hearing the Word Preached and Sacraments (as you will certainly own) why then that Law and Power, that enjoyns and commands attendance in theſe, is in ſubordination to the Law of the Spirit, and is both lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, eſpecially if you do but conſider, the Atheiſm and Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as well as the Faction and Giddineſs of the Age; ſo that not to uſe this Power, in ſuch an Age would be in ſome ſence to Blaſpheme the Legiſlative and Executive Power of Chriſt in his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether to force and compell Men in the Worſhip and Service of God, to act againſt their lights and judgments be not a Spiritual Rape upon their Conſciences.</p>
            <p n="8">8 A. <hi>The Spiritual Rape you talk of is committed by your ſelves, upon your own underſtandings, who deny to hear Chriſtian light and liberty ſo plainly preach'd and proved, that wholly removes all occaſion of that force you ſpake of, to all candid and unprejudiced Hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether it be not the duty of all Chriſtians to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo far as they have attained, and in other things wait the Revelation of the mind of God, to them that differ <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.16.</p>
            <p n="9">9 A. <hi>It is undoubtedly the duty of all Chriſtians, having attained the knowledge of the Goſpel, to walk together in Goſpel Communion, and not to make Schiſms and Separations</hi> Ro. 16.17. Heb. 10.25.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:135336:4"/> 
               <hi>And to that Scripture you ſpake of in</hi> Phil. 2.15.16. <hi>it is altogether alien to your purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether in thoſe duties whereon Eternity depends, it be not the higheſt abſurdity to force any againſt there own light, to be guided by others who are not Infallible.</p>
            <p n="10">10 A. <hi>It is rather the higheſt abſurdity in the World, for any Man in the great concern of Eternity, to truſt to his own light, eſpecially when he hath an Infallible Light to be guided by,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scriptures Preach'd and Explained, Read</hi> Iſaiah 8.17.18.19.20.</p>
            <p n="11">11 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether it be not moſt unreaſonable in the Concerns of Eternity, to tye Men by temporal Penalty to fallible guides, whom to follow may be their Eternal Ruin, to forſake their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ruin.</p>
            <p n="11">11 A. <hi>I deny the ſuppoſition, Our Church doth not tye Men (as you ſuppoſe) to any fallible Guide, but only to the Infallible Spirit and word which guideth: and to the Church which is guided according to truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether are they who ſeparate, or who gives the cauſe of Separation the Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p n="12">12 A. <hi>They who give the cauſe of ſeparation are the greateſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiſts, but ſuch as ſeparate when and where there is no cauſe given are as great as the greateſt ſeparatiſt and altogether unexcuſable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Q.</hi> Whether they who in the Exerciſe of Church Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, never leave calling on the Civil Majeſtrate, to aſſiſt him with his ſecular Force, do not herein give an evident ſign and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that all true Miniſterial and Spiritual Power is dead in them.</p>
            <p n="13">13. A. <hi>I know no ſuch Men now, as thoſe you ſpeak of; but I have heard, and read, of thoſe who in the late Wars: have (in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits with a Stentorian clamour) called to come to the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty; meaning the King and Church; who I ſuppoſe were Miniſters of the Authors Complexion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">14 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether ſince Offences will come, it be not every ones concern to be more than ordinarily careful, he involves not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the dreadful Woe pronounced againſt thoſe by whom they come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.7.</p>
            <p n="14">14. A. <hi>Woe be to them, who by their Obſtinacy and Diſobedience give Offence to lawful Governours and Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether can any think<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they who perſecute Chriſt

            <p n="15">15. A. <hi>I deny your Hipotheſis; and I do affirm that there is no ſuch Perſecution as you ſuppoſe, if there be any thing like Perſecution at this time among us, it is that of the tongue, ſhooting bitter and ſharp Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows againſt ſober and painful conforming Miniſters; who by life, and love, and labour, would convince and perſuade Gain ſayers to God and his Church, and would uſe no other means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, <hi>You did lately in an earneſt manner in your Sermon intreat Perſons candidly to reaſon things with you, and ſaid if any one ſaw you in an error, they ſhould give you warning, and not ſuffer you to go on in ſin, wherefore pray accept of this in Love, and conſider it well for it is intended for your good, and done without any Reflection or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil thought of the preſent Government according to that in</hi> Tim. 2.1, 2. v. <hi>and</hi> 1 Pet. 2.17. <hi>I Say God ſave the King,</hi> Amen.</p>
            <p>A. <hi>The laſt part of your laſt Queſtion I own, and ſhould be glad to know your name and the place of your abode, that I may receive if poſſible ſome greater ſatisfaction from your Perſon then I have from your Paper.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Q.</hi> Whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> as eſtabliſh'd by Law, be a Lawful Church, and if you think this be a <hi>Noli me tangere.</hi> Pray then.</p>
